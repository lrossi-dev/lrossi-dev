### Hi, I'm Leonardo Rossi

Backend developer, FOSS enthusiast and coffee drinker :coffee:


**Here, a few things I'd like to share with you:**
* I'm passionate about everything Linux-related, and love to spend free time tweaking and messing with my config files;
* I love exercising, gardening and cooking (might share some of my recipies here sometime 👨‍🍳);

**What programming languages have I been studying? Glad you asked:**
* Python;
* Bash;
* Some automation tools like Ansible;
* A lot of my projects here are just config files or forks of software that I use a lot;
