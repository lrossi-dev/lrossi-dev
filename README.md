### Hi, I'm Leonardo Rossi

Backend developer, OSS enthusiast and coffee drinker :coffee:


**Here, a few things I'd like to share with you:**
* I currently work with Java, Kotlin and Node.js applications;
* I'm passionate about everything Linux-related, and love to spend free time tweaking and messing with my config files;
* I love exercising, gardening and cooking (might share some of my recipies here sometime 👨‍🍳);
* I'm currently studying to get certified by Java and taking some canonical readings on Design Patterns;

**What programming languages have I been studying? Glad you asked:**
* I haven't been messing aroung with the languages I work with in a daily basis;
* A lot of my projects here are just config files or forks of software that I use a lot;
